## Overview

Users enter a number between 1 and 20 in order to guess which number is behind the question mark. Wrong guesses result in points from the original score being subtracted.

## My process

The HTML & CSS was provided by Jonas Schmedtmann through his JavaScript course, while the Javascript was written by myself.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was my fist project using JavaScript, so it was very intimidating. I slowly worked through it and managed to complete about half of it on my own. Although it was fun, it highlighted that I need to work a bit more on functions, especially the different types like arrow functions.

Some code that I'm proud of:

```js
document.querySelector('.again').addEventListener('click', function () {
  score = 20;
  secretNumber = Math.trunc(Math.random() * 20) + 1;

  displayMessage('❌Enter A Number❌');
  document.querySelector('.number').textContent = '?';
  //resets .guess input to blank
  document.querySelector('.guess').value = '';
  document.querySelector('.score').textContent = score;
  document.querySelector('body').style.backgroundColor = '#9cd2ed';
  document.querySelector('.number').style.width = '15rem';
});
```

### Continued development

I would love to focus on more complex, multiplayer projects as that would be more difficult and would challenge me to become a better developer.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) - This helped me learn the basics of JavaScript and how to manipulate different elements within the DOM.
